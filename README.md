# NewYear-Countdown

This one is a part of my 100 Days of Swift challenge. I decided to remake my school days console application (originally written in Pascal) which tells user number of days left before New Year's. 

User input should be provided in this format:
month (Int)
day (Int)
year (Int)

Don't take it seriously, just mastering Swift syntax ;)
